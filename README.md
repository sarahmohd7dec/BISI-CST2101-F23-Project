		We are analyzing different aspects of Diabetes in the Pima tribe by doing Exploratory Data Analysis.
		We are also doing Model Development by splitting the data and trying to achieve high accuracy on the training data
  but also to generalize and perform well on test data. Therefore, the focus is on creating a model 
  that can capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, rather than simply memorizing 
  the training data.We are also Comparing the model that achieves higher accuracy and also the model with better confusion matrix
		
A few years ago research was done on a tribe in America which is called the Pima tribe (also known as the Pima Indians). 
In this tribe, it was found that the ladies are prone to diabetes very early.
Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. 
In particular, all patients were females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
		

		

		Data Dictionary
		The dataset has the following information:
		

		Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

		Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

		BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

		SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

		Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

		BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

		DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history.

		Age: Age in years

		Outcome : Class variable (0: person is not diabetic or 1: person is diabetic)
